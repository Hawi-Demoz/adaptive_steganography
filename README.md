# Adaptive Steganography

This project provides tools for adaptive steganography, focusing on hiding and extracting data within audio files. It supports encryption for secure data embedding and includes:

- Embedding and extraction of hidden data
- Adaptive masking techniques
- Encryption for data security
- Example and test scripts

## Folder Structure
- `data/original/`: Original audio files
- `data/stego/`: Files with embedded data
- `src/`: Source code for embedding, extraction, masking, and encryption

## Usage
Run scripts in the `src/` folder to embed, encrypt, or extract hidden data from audio files.
